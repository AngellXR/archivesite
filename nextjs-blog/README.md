# Summary

AngellXR is a community devoted to an open source Metaverse. Feel free to make contributions based on your own expertise. We are always looking to grow our community with more good people.

This is the first iteration of our website. If you like this website, you can build your own at [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

# AngellXR is fully dedicated to the open source Metaverse. We seek to lift up other XR creators and guide the community towards open access for all. XRShowcase is the first open product we've launched, intended to link-to and showcase other XR creations.

To contribute your project to XR Showcase, we just need a URL. It is recommended that you use tools, and frameworks that result in cross-compatible experiences.

To improve XRShowcase, please fork and submit a PR. The person writing this is a product manager. Save me from myself. <3

# What does AngellXR do?

We are an open community dedicated to the open Metaverse. We believe everyone can add value to and benefit from the Metaverse. We believe in lifting each other up as the Metaverse is bigger than all of us. We value mobile first (while we still have phones) as it lowers the barrier to entry for users to experience the Metaverse.

We strive to make everything we do open source, and expandable. It has to be bigger than one person.

AngellXR is currently a loose collection of pirates and innovators working together to create the open Metaverse. Our products are designed to be accessible, open, and as much as possible: free. Our first product sandboXR was created to help XR creators federate and co-create their XR work. To add your project to the page visit our sandboXR page.

This page was created with nextjs. I am a Product person with a strong interest in development. Our team works every day to improve our craft, however, we embrace "not knowing what we don't know."

If you see something you could improve, please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

Best,

Jesse
