AngellXR is a community devoted to an open Metaverse. Feel free to make contributions based on your own expertise. We are always looking to grow our community with more good people.

This is the first iteration of our website. If you like this website, you can build your own at [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

-to start server use: npm run dev

AngellXR is currently a loose collection of pirates and innovators working together to create the open Metaverse. Our products are designed to be accessible, open, and as much as possible: free. Our first product sandboXR was created to help XR creators federate and co-create their XR work. To add your project to the page visit our sandboXR page.

This page was created with nextjs. I am a Product person with a strong interest in development. Our team works every day to improve our craft, however, we embrace "not knowing what we don't know."

If you see something you could improve, please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

Best,

Jesse
